From this project, we get the raw data and clean the data, then analyse those data. Finally, we conclude that there may global warming issues from 2006 to 2016 based on temperature and humidity factors.

(2) Recognizing Handwritten Digits with Scikit-Learn

From this project, we predit a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font. we will have an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability, it will produce a prediction with the predict() function.

 (3)Analysing Movie Reviews using Sentiment analysis
 
This project focuses on Text pre-processing and Normalization using NLP, Sentiment analysis using the Unsupervised Lexicon-based models and classifying sentiment using Traditional supervised models.
